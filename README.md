# Kata Snippets
Sometimes when I work on katas on [Codewars](https://codewars.com/) or [HackerRank](https://hackerrank.com/), I find the built-in IDE wanting, either because I need a debugger or I'm working with multiple files. In those cases, I work on the code on my own machine with my preferred setup. As a result, I've accumulated little bits and bobs of mostly fun code that I've put into this repository.

## Honour System
If you got here googling solutions for something on Codewars or HackerRank, well, it's a free world. Pick up ideas if you want, but don't cheat yourself.

### Caveat Emptor
Much of this code was used for taking advantage of my own development environment for _debugging_, before being copy-pasted back into Codewars or HackerRank for scoring. There is absolutely no guarantee that it will pass the test cases on Codewars or HackerRank as is. Quite often the code here failed some test case or the other that I quickly fixed in the browser.
